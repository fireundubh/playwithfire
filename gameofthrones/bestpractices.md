# Best Practices
## Priorities

1. Focus on research above everything else. In the early game when you have only the Infantry-Cavalry formation, research upgrades for infantry and cavalry. Infantry and Cavalry will take heavy losses otherwise.
2. Build Hospitals to increase your wounded limit. Your wounded limit should be above or equal to your troop size to reduce troop deaths.
3. Always be training troops and constructing fortifications.

## Commanders

### Recommended Configurations

Requires Black Diamonds | Tier | Frontline 1 | Frontline 2 | Frontline 3 | Backline 1 | Backline 2 | Backline 3
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Yes | 1 | Kevin | Chris (free) | Gorell (free) | Theon | Soren (free) | Sheila (free)
Yes | 2 | Kevin | Chris (free) | Gorell (free) | Arya (free) | Melissandra | Soren (free)
Yes | 3 | Rob Stark (free) | Chris (free) | Kevin | Sheila (free) | Melissandra | Arya (free)
Yes | 4 | Chris (free) | Kevin | Gorell (free) | Sansa Stark (free) | Theon | Arya (free)
Yes | 5 | Chris (free) | Kevin | Rob Stark (free) | Daenerys | Gorell (free) | Arya (free)

### Upgrading

1. Improve the quality of commanders to advance base stats.
2. Promote commanders to improve skills and increase commander power.
3. Level up commanders to satisfy item requirements. Leveling has no other benefits.

## Economy

- Build only one Farm, one Lumberyard, and one Quarry. Grain, Wood, and Stones are more than plentiful.
- Build Mints to generate Gold Dragons and increase training speed.
- Build Mines to generate Iron. Iron resources are less abundant in the late game. 

## Military

- Focus on training 60-80% Bowmen and 20% Spearmen. Bowmen and Spearmen are the most powerful combination in the game.
- Focus on researching Tier 3 (Elite) troops. Start with Bowmen, then Spearmen, then Infantry, then Cavalry.
- Do not research Tier 4 (Royal) until you have nothing else to research. Tier 4 takes a long, long time to research.
- Research Spying 9 as soon as possible.

## Rallies/Raids

- Do not start or join rallies against Rebel Camps without scouting first.
- Do not start or join rallies against Rebel Camps immediately before Castle Sieges. Your alliance needs you to be ready.
- Always share Scouting Reports with your Alliance.
