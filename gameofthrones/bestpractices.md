# Best Practices
## Alliances

If you're coming here from K17 and you're a member of 7 Deadly Sins, join Meet Your Maker! Here's how we're different:

Attribute | Meet Your Maker | 7 Deadly Sins
---: | :--- | :---
**Culture** | Friendly, casual, and relaxed | Bureaucratic, cold, and paranoid about spies
**Politics** | None | Only members of the "inner circle" matter; power trips; constant infighting; drama
**Roleplay** | None | Encouraged; all leadership messages are written in Olde English (translated from German)
**Alliance Leadership** | Strong; community-oriented; fun | Weak; abdicates responsibilities to "inner circle"; makes the game feel like a job you never wanted
**Siege Leadership** | Collaborative; fun | Hierarchical, unable to adapt, and inexperienced
**King's Landing** | Won handily; offers buffs to other alliances | Lost badly; never offered buffs to other alliances
**Rallies** | <ul><li>Frequent<li>All Rebel Camp levels allowed<li>T2 and T3 allowed<li>Will use Race Boots to make sure everyone can participate</ul> | <ul>Rare<li>Only Lv. 5 Rebel Camps allowed<li>T3 only<li>Sending T1 or T2 troops will get you kicked</ul>
**Discord** | Yes; not required for membership | Yes; absolutely required for membership

## Priorities

1. Focus on research above everything else. In the early game when you have only the Infantry-Cavalry formation, research upgrades for infantry and cavalry. Infantry and Cavalry will take heavy losses otherwise.
2. Build Hospitals to increase your wounded limit. Your wounded limit should be above or equal to your troop size to reduce troop deaths.
3. Always be training troops and constructing fortifications.

## General Recommendations
### Alliance Gifts

1. At VIP Level 8, you can quickly claim all alliance gifts. You should aim for VIP Level 9.
2. Alternatively, you can use [X-Mouse Button Control](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm) to [rebind a mouse button](https://i.imgur.com/hv5Cj2I.jpg) to rapidly accept and delete gifts.

### Alliance Shop / Diamond Shop

1. The only item worth buying in the Alliance Shop is the Talent Archive. The Talent Archive allows you to save and restore your talent configurations.
2. You can buy Precise Transfer scrolls from the Diamond Shop for 1,500 Diamonds. You will need at least 3 scrolls for sieges.

## Commanders

### Recommended Configurations

Requires Black Diamonds | Tier | Frontline 1 | Frontline 2 | Frontline 3 | Backline 1 | Backline 2 | Backline 3
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Yes | 1 | Kevin | Chris (free) | Gorell (free) | Theon | Soren (free) | Sheila (free)
Yes | 2 | Kevin | Chris (free) | Gorell (free) | Arya (free) | Melissandra | Soren (free)
Yes | 3 | Rob Stark (free) | Chris (free) | Kevin | Sheila (free) | Melissandra | Arya (free)
Yes | 4 | Chris (free) | Kevin | Gorell (free) | Sansa Stark (free) | Theon | Arya (free)
Yes | 5 | Chris (free) | Kevin | Rob Stark (free) | Daenerys | Gorell (free) | Arya (free)

### Upgrading

1. Improve the quality of commanders to advance base stats.
2. Promote commanders to improve skills and increase commander power.
3. Level up commanders to satisfy item requirements. Leveling has no other benefits.

### Weirwood

1. Blitzing battles allows you to collect items for upgrading and promoting commanders.
2. To unlock battles for blitzes, you must get three stars on those battles, and to do that, you need to win the battle with all commanders alive.
3. You will likely not be able to achieve three stars for the first time on some battles, but you can always go back and try again when your commanders are more powerful.
4. When you are more powerful, try to get three stars on every battle in a chapter. This will unlock three reward chests for each chapter, which provide Diamonds and Spirits of Weirwood Tree.

## Economy

- Build only one Farm, one Lumberyard, and one Quarry. Grain, Wood, and Stones are more than plentiful.
- Build Mints to generate Gold Dragons and increase training speed.
- Build Mines to generate Iron. Iron resources are less abundant in the late game. 

### Gathering

Complete daily gathering activities by dispatching just enough Cavalry to collect the following:

Resource | Qty | Source | Rewards
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Gold Dragons | 2,000 | Mint | 1x 10 mins Speed Up, 1x 5 mins Speed Up (Heal), points toward reward chest/wheel
Iron | 5,000 | Mine | 1x 10 mins Speed Up, 1x 5 mins Speed Up (Heal), points toward reward chest/wheel
Wood | 5,000 | Lumberyard | 1x 10 mins Speed Up, 1x 5 mins Speed Up (Heal), points toward reward chest/wheel
Stone | 5,000 | Quarry | 1x 10 mins Speed Up, 1x 5 mins Speed Up (Heal), points toward reward chest/wheel
Grain | 10,000 | Farm | 1x 10 mins Speed Up, 1x 5 mins Speed Up (Heal), points toward reward chest/wheel

You can complete some number of these activities in parallel within minutes depending on your Castle level.

## Military
### Building, Research & Training

- Focus on training 60-80% Bowmen and 20% Spearmen. Bowmen and Spearmen are the most powerful combination in the game.
- Focus on researching Tier 3 (Elite) troops. Start with Bowmen, then Spearmen, then Infantry, then Cavalry.
- Do not research Tier 4 (Royal) until you have nothing else to research. Tier 4 takes a long, long time to research.
- In the early game, research Spying 9 as soon as possible to increase the amount of detail in your Scouting Reports.
- Upgrade your Rookery to 17 as soon as possible to provide you with the most information about the battlefield and incoming attacks.

### Castle Defense

- Anti-infantry and anti-cavalry fortifications are powerful while everyone is locked into the Infantry-Cavalry formation.
- Fortifications are only effective while your Wall durability is greater than zero.
- For castle defense, focus on researching improvements to wall durability.

### Decoys

You can rapidly attack enemy players with multiple deployments of 1 Cavalry unit. These decoys are useful for two reasons:

- Cavalry units travel faster than other units, so they will reach the destination quickly. Scouts are much faster but more expensive, and they cannot die.
- Enemy players who have sheltered their troops are unlikely to recall their troops due to the constant attack pressure.
- Enemy players who have not upgraded their Rookery cannot see the number of units in your deployments.
- If the enemy player recalls their troops from the shelter, you will lose a single Cavalry unit and receive a notification your army was annihilated.
- When the enemy player catches on to your ruse, you can surprise them with a full attack.

You can also use decoys to bait enemy players into attacking you so that your allies can destroy their walls, capture their lord, and/or raid their resources.

### Siege Positioning

Do not teleport to Great City Special Area tiles unless you can afford to keep a significant army at your city. If you are attacked in a Great City Special Area and you are defeated, your city will be randomly teleported somewhere on the map and you will have to use another Precise Transfer to get back to the fight.

## Rallies/Raids

- Do not start or join rallies against Rebel Camps without scouting first.
- Do not start or join rallies against Rebel Camps immediately before Castle Sieges. Your alliance needs you to be ready.
- Always share Scouting Reports with your Alliance.
- Always manage your rallies by sending Tier 1 (Light) troops home, by sending distant armies home, and by sending any armies home when requested by their Lords.
