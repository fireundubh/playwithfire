## Economy

- Build only one Farm, one Lumberyard, and one Quarry. Grain, Wood, and Stones are more than plentiful.

- Build Mines to generate Iron. Iron resources are less abundant in the late game. 

## Military

- Focus on training Bowmen and Spearmen. Bowmen and Spearmen are the most powerful combination in the game.
