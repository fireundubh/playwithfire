# Welcome

Welcome to **#playwithfire**, a wiki that's all about creating aftermarket game content (mods!) and tools to make that a bit easier.

I'm **fireundubh** (a Gaelic phrase pronounced *feer-uhn-doÍžo*) but most people just call me ðŸ”¥. I make stuff.

# Site News

- **20 Feb 2020:** Updated Wiki.js to 2.1.113
- **19 Jan 2020:** Updated Wiki.js to 2.0.12. It's going to take some time to make pages look nice again.

# Browsing

On the navigation bar to your left, you can find the main sections of the wiki. Everything is a work-in-progress.

At the top of the page, you can find things with the search box.

# Contributing

You can submit a pull request to the [playwithfire repository](https://github.com/fireundubh/playwithfire) on GitHub.
