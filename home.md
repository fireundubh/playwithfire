# Welcome

Welcome to **#playwithfire**, a wiki that's all about creating aftermarket game content (mods!) and tools to make that a bit easier.

I'm **fireundubh** (a Gaelic phrase pronounced *feer-uhn-doÍžo*) but most people just call me ðŸ”¥. I make stuff.

# Browsing

On the navigation bar to your left, you can find the main sections of the wiki. Everything is a work-in-progress.

At the top of the page, you can find things with the search box.

# Contributing

You can submit a pull request to the [playwithfire repository](https://github.com/fireundubh/playwithfire) on GitHub.
