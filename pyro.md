**Pyro** is an open source build automation tool for *Skyrim*, *Skyrim Special Edition*, and *Fallout 4* projects.


# Benefits

- **Convenient** &mdash; Pyro is an all-in-one tool for compiling Papyrus scripts, packaging BSA/BA2 archives, and creating ZIP releases.
- **Fast** &mdash; Pyro uses a parallelized incremental build system to batch compile only scripts that you've changed.
- **Powerful** &mdash; Pyro can be extended through import and build events, and integrated into any IDE and CI/CD workflow.
