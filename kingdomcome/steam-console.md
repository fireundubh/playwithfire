# Using Steam to Download Previous Versions
## Step by Step

1. With Steam running, go to this URL in your browser: `steam://nav/console`. If nothing happens in Chrome, use Internet Explorer.
2. Enter the following command: `download_depot <app_id> <depot_id> <manifest_id>`
3. The depot will begin downloading. You should receive a notification when the download is complete.

The depot will likely download to: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_379430\depot_379432\`

Once downloaded, you can move the depot anywhere.
