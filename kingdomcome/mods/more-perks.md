## Fixed Perks

Perk Category | Perk Name | Difference
:--- | :--- | :---
Strength | Clinch Master I | The description states the perk increases the overpower chance by 1/3 (33.333%), but the perk actually increases the overpower chance by 40%. The description was changed to reflect the actual effect.
Strength | Heavy Swing I | In game version 1.3, the damage increase was reduced from 20% (1.2) to 3% (1.03). The intended change was likely to increase damage to 30%. More Perks v1.4.1 changes the damage increase back to 20%.
Agility | Fast Striker I | The description states: "Your attacks will demand 30% less stamina, but will also cause 20% less injury." In game version 1.3, damage reduction was decreased from 20% to 10%. The descriptions for all Fast Striker perks were updated to reflect this change.
Defence | Golem | The description states that "your armour is a third more frightening than usual." The effect was increased from 30% to 33.333333%.
Misc. | Cuman Killer | The description states this perk increases damage against Cumans by 200%. In game version 1.3, the damage bonus was reduced from 200% to 20%. The description was updated to reflect this change.

## Patch Notes

### Version 1.4.3

- Added a Level 16 Warfare perk, Bloody Mess, that increases attack speed and bloodiness by 20% with each uninterrupted strike for 8 seconds
- Burgher perk now increases the moving speed multiplier from 1.1 (+10%) to 1.2 (+20%) and no longer adds 1 Charisma (for consistency with Savage)
- Cloak and Dagger perk now reduces footstep noise by 10% instead of reducing Visibility by 10
- Local Hero perk no longer adds 1 Charisma (for consistency with Infamous)
- Mummer now reduces Visibility by 10% instead of reducing Visibility by 10
- Savage perk now increases the moving speed multiplier from 1.1 (+10%) to 1.2 (+20%)

Cloak and Dagger, and Mummer, were nerfed because reducing Visibility by 10 (or 20 with both perks) made Henry invisible.
