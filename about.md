# Briefly

I'm **fireundubh**, but people just call me fire.

I have been a mod author since 1995. My mods are consistently top ranked, and my work has been featured on GameSpot, Kotaku, and various YouTube channels whose videos have received 1.5M+ views. I also develop tools for other mod authors in Python, C#, C++, and Delphi.

In the real world, I'm a technical producer with 20 years of game industry experience, from testing to marketing. I've worked on games for PC, Mac, Linux, and PlayStation devices at Sony Computer Entertainment, Sony Online Entertainment, and various studios.

I enjoy figuring out how games work, how to take them apart, and how to put them back together again better than before.

All mods I create are released free of charge and sometimes the tools I make are open sourced.

## Selected tools

- I am a contributing developer on [xEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit). My work includes reverse engineering most of the *Fallout 4* plugin. This work helped jumpstart the *Fallout 4* modding community before the Creation Kit was released. My other contributions focus on UX and scripting enhancements.
- I created [Pyro](https://github.com/fireundubh/pyro), a parallelized incremental build system for *Fallout 4*, *Skyrim Special Edition*, and *Skyrim* projects. Integrated with Joel Day's Papyrus extension for Visual Studio Code.
- I created [Modsmith](https://github.com/fireundubh/modsmith), a build system for *Kingdom Come: Deliverance* projects, that introduces build automation to the ecosystem. Modders get more work done faster and keep mods up-to-date across game patches with minimal effort.
- For [LSLib](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib), a tool for creating, extracting, and converting game data for the Divinity: Original Sin series, I developed a C# interface used to automate the packaging process.
- I contributed to [Wrye Bash](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash), a mod manager for *Elder Scrolls* and *Fallout* games. I updated the NSIS installer and uninstaller, including: adding 64-bit, *Skyrim Special Edition*, and *Nehrim* support; and fixing Windows Registry issues.
- I wrote  a Delphi script used by LOOT maintainers and Wrye Bash modders who help you sort mods and create intelligent bashed patches for the *Elder Scrolls* and *Fallout* games.
