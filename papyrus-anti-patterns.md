> "An **anti-pattern** is like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution, but isn't one." â€”Andrew Koenig, who originally coined the term in 1995

This working document aims to present all the ways modders write "bad Papyrus" and how to avoid doing so. It is modeled after [The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/index.html).

# Correctness
