## Nexus Community Features

### Why do you have Posts disabled?

1. When I'm messaged feedback, I can address that feedback at my own pace.
2. I'm responsible for many mods across many games. Each Posts tab constitutes a community. I have neither the time nor the inclination to moderate dozens of communities.
3. I also shut off comments for the same reason [Popular Science shut off comments](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments).

### Why do you have Bugs disabled?

The issue tracker provided by the Nexus is rather poorly designed and implemented. [Nexus doesn't even use their own tracker](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/web-issues/issues).

### Where can I send feedback?

I accept feedback by private message on the Nexus, Reddit, and Discord. Patreon and PayPal contributors may also send me feedback via email.
