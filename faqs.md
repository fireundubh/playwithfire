## Community

### Why do you have the Posts tab disabled on the Nexus?

1. When I'm messaged feedback, I can address that feedback at my own pace.
2. I'm responsible for many mods across many games. Each Posts tab constitutes a community. I have neither the time nor the inclination to moderate dozens of communities.
3. I also shut off comments for the same reason that [Popular Science shut off comments](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments).

### Why do you have the Bugs tab disabled on the Nexus?

The issue tracker provided by the Nexus is rather poorly designed and implemented. [The Nexus doesn't even use their own tracker.](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/web-issues/issues)

### Where can I send feedback?

I accept feedback by private message on the Nexus, Reddit, and Discord. Patreon subscribers and PayPal donors may also send me feedback via email.

## Reporting Issues

### How do I report issues effectively?

When sending me an issue by private message, follow these guidelines.

Field | Guideline
:--- | :---
Subject | Prefix the subject line with the name of the game and the name of the mod.
Body | Be specific, concise, and include only relevant information.<br><br>Use the following structure for reporting issues:<br><br>SUMMARY<br>The summary quickly explains what does not happen.<br><br>CONDITIONS<br>The conditions describe the state of the operating environment at the time the issue occurred.<br><br>Use only when needed.<br><br>STEPS TO REPRODUCE<br>The steps to reproduce describe the procedure by which any other user can experience the same issue.<br><br>Use only when reproducing the issue has either:<br>-	a frequency lower than 100%, or<br>-	when reproduction is sufficiently complex to warrant instructions.<br><br>RESULT<br>The result describes what actually happened.<br><br>This is the only section that is required.<br><br>Do not use a heading when reporting only the result.<br><br>EXPECTED RESULT<br>The expected result describes what should have happened.<br><br>Use only when the expected result is not obvious.

Always use headings when including two or more sections.

### How do I provide evidence of issues?

-	Simple and easily reproduced issues may not require evidence (e.g., text issues.)
-	When evidence may be needed, please use your judgement to provide the game version, the mod version, logs, screenshots, video, DirectX diagnostics, system information, etc.
-	When in doubt about what evidence would be useful toward tracking down and resolving a specific issue, ask me.
