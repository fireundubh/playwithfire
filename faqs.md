# Frequently Asked Questions
## Modding

### What mods have you created?

I've been creating mods for 23 years. I'm best known for the following mods:

Game | Mod | Downloads/Subscribers (K) | Positive Ratings (K)
:--- | :--- | ---: | ---:
Kingdom Come: Deliverance | [Lockpicking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/3) | 158 | 1.7
Divinity: Original Sin 2 | [Let There Be Tooltips!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1506230499) | 151 | 1.1
Skyrim Special Edition | [Master of Disguise SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9959) | 55 | 1.3
Fallout 4 | [Auto Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27719) | 30 | 1

In addition, I am a contributor to xEdit, was a Fallout 4 Creation Kit closed beta participant, and I build modding tools, too.

I also received an invite to the Divinity Engine 2 beta for the Definitive Edition of Divinity: Original Sin 2, but I didn't see it until the toolkit was released. RIP.

## Community

### Why do you have the Posts tab disabled on the Nexus?

1. When I'm messaged feedback, I can address that feedback at my own pace.
2. I'm responsible for many mods across many games. Each Posts tab constitutes a community. I have neither the time nor the inclination to moderate dozens of communities.
3. I also shut off comments for the same reason that [Popular Science shut off comments](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments).

### Why do you have the Bugs tab disabled on the Nexus?

The issue tracker provided by the Nexus is poorly designed and implemented. [The Nexus doesn't even use their own tracker.](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/web-issues/issues)

### Can I persuade you to enable the Posts and/or Bugs tabs on the Nexus?

No, my workflow is not up for discussion.

### Where can I send feedback then?

I accept feedback by *private message* on the Nexus, Reddit, and Discord. Patreon subscribers and PayPal donors may also send me feedback via email.

### You haven't responded to my message in 30 minutes! What gives?

I try to respond to everyone, but I do receive a lot of messages. If you haven't heard from me in *1 week*, ping me.


## Reporting Issues

### How do I report issues effectively?

When sending me an issue by private message, follow these guidelines.

Field | Guideline
:--- | :---
**Subject** | Include the game name and mod name.
**Body** | Be specific, concise, and include only relevant information.<br><br>Use the following structure for reporting issues:<br><br>**Summary**<br>The summary quickly explains what does not happen in 140 characters or less.<br><br>**Conditions**<br>The conditions describe the state of the operating environment at the time the issue occurred. Use only when needed.<br><br>**Steps to Reproduce**<br>The steps to reproduce describe the procedure by which any other user can experience the same issue.<br><br>Use only when reproducing the issue has either:<br>-	a frequency lower than 100%, or<br>-	when reproducing the issue warrants instructions.<br><br>**Result**<br>The result describes what actually happened. This is the only section that is required.<br><br>**Expected Result**<br>The expected result describes what should have happened. Use only when the expected result is not obvious.

**Remember:** The less work I have to do to determine how to reproduce the issue, the faster I can address the issue. Help me help you.

### How do I provide evidence of issues?

-	Simple and easily reproduced issues may not require evidence (e.g., text issues.)
-	When evidence may be needed, please use your judgement to provide the game version, the mod version, logs, screenshots, video, DirectX diagnostics, system information, etc.
-	When in doubt about what evidence would be useful for tracking down and resolving a specific issue, ask me.
